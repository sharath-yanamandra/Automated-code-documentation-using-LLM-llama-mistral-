Mini Insurance Calculator for P&C Insurance

A simplified module for basic P&C insurance calculations.



## Class: `InsurancePolicy`

# InsurancePolicy Class

The `InsurancePolicy` class represents a basic insurance policy for P&C insurance. It is designed to simplify the process of calculating monthly payments and managing policy details.

## Properties/Attributes

### `policy_id`

A unique identifier for the policy. This attribute is used to identify the policy within the system.

### `customer_name`

The name of the insured customer. This attribute stores the name of the person or entity that is covered by the policy.

### `premium`

The annual premium amount for the policy. This attribute stores the amount paid by the insured customer each year to maintain coverage.

### `coverage_amount`

The maximum coverage amount for the policy. This attribute stores the maximum amount that the policy will pay out in the event of a covered loss.

### `is_active`

A boolean indicating whether the policy is currently active or not. This attribute is used to manage the status of the policy and determine whether it is eligible for coverage.

## Methods

### `__init__(policy_id, customer_name, premium, coverage_amount)`

Initializes a new insurance policy with the given parameters. This method creates a new instance of the `InsurancePolicy` class and sets its properties based on the input values.

### `calculate_monthly_payment()`

Calculates the monthly payment for this policy. This method returns the amount that the insured customer must pay each month to maintain coverage under the policy.

## Insurance-Specific Terminology

The following terms are used in the context of P&C insurance:

### `premium`

The annual premium amount paid by the insured customer to maintain coverage under the policy. The premium is typically calculated as a percentage of the coverage amount.

### `coverage_amount`

The maximum amount that the policy will pay out in the event of a covered loss. This is also known as the limit of liability.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `InsurancePolicy` class in the context of P&C insurance:

```python
# Create a new policy with a unique identifier, customer name, premium amount, and coverage amount
policy = InsurancePolicy(1234567890, "John Doe", 1000.00, 500000)

# Calculate the monthly payment for the policy
monthly_payment = policy.calculate_monthly_payment()
print(f"Monthly Payment: ${monthly_payment}")
```

In this example, we create a new `InsurancePolicy` instance with a unique identifier of 1234567890, a customer name of "John Doe", a premium amount of $1000.00 per year, and a coverage amount of $500,000. We then call the `calculate_monthly_payment` method to calculate the monthly payment for the policy, which we print to the console.

```python
# Check if the policy is active or not
if policy.is_active:
    print("Policy is active")
else:
    print("Policy is inactive")
```

In this example, we check the `is_active` attribute of the policy to determine whether it is currently eligible for coverage. If the attribute is `True`, we print a message indicating that the policy is active. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that the policy is inactive.



### Method: `InsurancePolicy.__init__`

### Method: `InsurancePolicy.cancel_policy`

# cancel\_policy Function Documentation

## Purpose
This function cancels an existing policy by setting its `is_active` attribute to `False`. This is useful when a policyholder decides not to renew their policy or if the policy has been terminated due to some other reason.

## Parameters
The function takes no parameters.

## Return Value
None. The function does not return any value.

## Exceptions
This function does not raise any exceptions.

## Example Usage
To cancel a policy, simply call the `cancel_policy` method on the policy object:
```python
policy = InsurancePolicy(policy_id='123456789', customer_name='John Smith', premium=1000, coverage_amount=50000)
policy.calculate_monthly_payment()
```
This will calculate the monthly payment for the policy and return the amount. If you want to cancel the policy, simply call the `cancel_policy` method on the policy object:
```python
policy.cancel_policy()
```
This will set the `is_active` attribute of the policy object to `False`, effectively cancelling the policy.

**Parameters**:
- **self**










### Function: `calculate_basic_premium`

# calculate\_basic\_premium Function Documentation

This function calculates a basic insurance premium based on the value of the insured property, location risk factor, and age risk factor.

## Purpose

The `calculate_basic_premium` function is used to calculate a basic insurance premium for a given property. The premium is calculated using a formula that takes into account the value of the property, the location risk factor, and the age risk factor.

## Parameters

### `property_value`

**Type:** `int` or `float`

**Default Value:** None

The value of the insured property. The property value should be in USD.

### `location_factor`

**Type:** `float`

**Default Value:** 1.0

The risk factor based on location. The location factor is a value between 1.0 and 2.0, where 1.0 represents low risk and 2.0 represents high risk.

### `age_factor`

**Type:** `float`

**Default Value:** 1.0

The risk factor based on age. The age factor is a value between 0.8 and 1.5, where 0.8 represents low risk and 1.5 represents high risk.

## Return Value

### `calculated_premium`

**Type:** `float`

The calculated basic insurance premium.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `calculate_basic_premium` function in an insurance scenario:

```python
property_value = 100000
location_factor = 1.2
age_factor = 1.5

calculated_premium = calculate_basic_premium(property_value, location_factor, age_factor)
print("Calculated premium:", calculated_premium)
```

Output:

```
Calculated premium: 1050.0
```

In this example, we calculate the basic insurance premium for a property with a value of $100,000, located in an area with a location risk factor of 1.2 and an age risk factor of 1.5.

## Notes

- The `calculate_basic_premium` function assumes that the property value is in USD.
- The location and age risk factors are used to adjust the base rate of $500, which represents the annual premium for a low-risk property. The formula used to calculate the adjusted rate is:

```python
adjusted_rate = base_rate * (property_value / 100000) * location_factor * age_factor
```

- The calculated premium is returned as a float value.
- This function does not handle exceptions or errors. If an error occurs, the function will continue executing and may produce unexpected results.

**Parameters**:
- **property_value**
- **location_factor**
- **age_factor**





### Function: `get_location_factor`

# get_location_factor Function Documentation

## Purpose
The `get_location_factor` function is used to determine the location risk factor based on a given ZIP code. This function is used in P&C insurance software to calculate insurance premiums.

## Parameters
### zip_code (str)
The ZIP code of the property being insured. The type of this parameter is `str` and its default value is an empty string (`''`).

## Return Value
The function returns a location risk factor between 1.0 and 2.0.

## Exceptions
No exceptions are thrown by this function.

## Usage Notes
This function is used in the `calculate_basic_premium` function to determine the location risk factor based on a given ZIP code. The location risk factor is then multiplied with an age risk factor and a base rate to calculate the insurance premium.

## Example Usage
```python
from pymysql import connect
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MySQL database
conn = connect(host='localhost', user='root', password='password', db='insurance')
