# calculate\_basic\_premium Function Documentation

This function calculates a basic insurance premium based on the value of the insured property, location risk factor, and age risk factor.

## Purpose

The `calculate_basic_premium` function is used to calculate a basic insurance premium for a given property. The premium is calculated using a formula that takes into account the value of the property, the location risk factor, and the age risk factor.

## Parameters

### `property_value`

**Type:** `int` or `float`

**Default Value:** None

The value of the insured property. The property value should be in USD.

### `location_factor`

**Type:** `float`

**Default Value:** 1.0

The risk factor based on location. The location factor is a value between 1.0 and 2.0, where 1.0 represents low risk and 2.0 represents high risk.

### `age_factor`

**Type:** `float`

**Default Value:** 1.0

The risk factor based on age. The age factor is a value between 0.8 and 1.5, where 0.8 represents low risk and 1.5 represents high risk.

## Return Value

### `calculated_premium`

**Type:** `float`

The calculated basic insurance premium.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `calculate_basic_premium` function in an insurance scenario:

```python
property_value = 100000
location_factor = 1.2
age_factor = 1.5

calculated_premium = calculate_basic_premium(property_value, location_factor, age_factor)
print("Calculated premium:", calculated_premium)
```

Output:

```
Calculated premium: 1050.0
```

In this example, we calculate the basic insurance premium for a property with a value of $100,000, located in an area with a location risk factor of 1.2 and an age risk factor of 1.5.

## Notes

- The `calculate_basic_premium` function assumes that the property value is in USD.
- The location and age risk factors are used to adjust the base rate of $500, which represents the annual premium for a low-risk property. The formula used to calculate the adjusted rate is:

```python
adjusted_rate = base_rate * (property_value / 100000) * location_factor * age_factor
```

- The calculated premium is returned as a float value.
- This function does not handle exceptions or errors. If an error occurs, the function will continue executing and may produce unexpected results.
