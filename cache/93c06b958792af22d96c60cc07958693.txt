from pccalculator import InsurancePolicy

# Create a new P&C insurance policy
policy = InsurancePolicy("12345", "John Smith", 1000, 50000)

# Calculate the monthly payment for this policy
monthly_payment = policy.calculate_monthly_payment()

print(f"Monthly Payment: ${monthly_payment:.2f}")
```

In this example, we create a new P&C insurance policy with the policy ID "12345", customer name "John Smith", annual premium of 1000, and maximum coverage amount of 50,000. We then call the `calculate_monthly_payment` function to calculate the monthly payment for this policy and print the result. The output should be:

```
Monthly Payment: $83.33
```

This means that the monthly payment for this policy is $83.33.
