# get_location_factor Function Documentation

## Purpose
The `get_location_factor` function is used to determine the location risk factor based on a given ZIP code. This function is used in P&C insurance software to calculate insurance premiums.

## Parameters
### zip_code (str)
The ZIP code of the property being insured. The type of this parameter is `str` and its default value is an empty string (`''`).

## Return Value
The function returns a location risk factor between 1.0 and 2.0.

## Exceptions
No exceptions are thrown by this function.

## Usage Notes
This function is used in the `calculate_basic_premium` function to determine the location risk factor based on a given ZIP code. The location risk factor is then multiplied with an age risk factor and a base rate to calculate the insurance premium.

## Example Usage
```python
from pymysql import connect
import pandas as pd

# Connect to MySQL database
conn = connect(host='localhost', user='root', password='password', db='insurance')

# Load policy data from CSV file
policy_data = pd.read_csv('policy_data.csv')

# Calculate insurance premiums for all policies
for index, row in policy_data.iterrows():
    property_value = row['property_value']
    age = row['age']
    zip_code = row['zip_code']
    
    # Get location risk factor based on ZIP code
    location_factor = get_location_factor(zip_code)
    
    # Calculate age risk factor
    if age < 18:
        age_factor = 0.8
    elif age >= 18 and age < 65:
        age_factor = 1.2
    else:
        age_factor = 1.5
    
    # Calculate basic premium
    basic_premium = calculate_basic_premium(property_value, location_factor, age_factor)
    
    # Update policy data with calculated premium
    policy_data.at[index, 'premium'] = basic_premium
