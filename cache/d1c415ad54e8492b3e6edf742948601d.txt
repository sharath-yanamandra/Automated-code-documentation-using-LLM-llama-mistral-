## Example Usage
To cancel a policy, simply call the `cancel_policy` method on the policy object:
```python
policy = InsurancePolicy(policy_id='123456789', customer_name='John Smith', premium=1000, coverage_amount=50000)
policy.calculate_monthly_payment()
```
This will calculate the monthly payment for the policy and return the amount. If you want to cancel the policy, simply call the `cancel_policy` method on the policy object:
```python
policy.cancel_policy()
```
This will set the `is_active` attribute of the policy object to `False`, effectively cancelling the policy.
