# InsurancePolicy Class

The `InsurancePolicy` class represents a basic insurance policy for P&C insurance. It is designed to simplify the process of calculating monthly payments and managing policy details.

## Properties/Attributes

### `policy_id`

A unique identifier for the policy. This attribute is used to identify the policy within the system.

### `customer_name`

The name of the insured customer. This attribute stores the name of the person or entity that is covered by the policy.

### `premium`

The annual premium amount for the policy. This attribute stores the amount paid by the insured customer each year to maintain coverage.

### `coverage_amount`

The maximum coverage amount for the policy. This attribute stores the maximum amount that the policy will pay out in the event of a covered loss.

### `is_active`

A boolean indicating whether the policy is currently active or not. This attribute is used to manage the status of the policy and determine whether it is eligible for coverage.

## Methods

### `__init__(policy_id, customer_name, premium, coverage_amount)`

Initializes a new insurance policy with the given parameters. This method creates a new instance of the `InsurancePolicy` class and sets its properties based on the input values.

### `calculate_monthly_payment()`

Calculates the monthly payment for this policy. This method returns the amount that the insured customer must pay each month to maintain coverage under the policy.

## Insurance-Specific Terminology

The following terms are used in the context of P&C insurance:

### `premium`

The annual premium amount paid by the insured customer to maintain coverage under the policy. The premium is typically calculated as a percentage of the coverage amount.

### `coverage_amount`

The maximum amount that the policy will pay out in the event of a covered loss. This is also known as the limit of liability.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `InsurancePolicy` class in the context of P&C insurance:

```python
# Create a new policy with a unique identifier, customer name, premium amount, and coverage amount
policy = InsurancePolicy(1234567890, "John Doe", 1000.00, 500000)

# Calculate the monthly payment for the policy
monthly_payment = policy.calculate_monthly_payment()
print(f"Monthly Payment: ${monthly_payment}")
```

In this example, we create a new `InsurancePolicy` instance with a unique identifier of 1234567890, a customer name of "John Doe", a premium amount of $1000.00 per year, and a coverage amount of $500,000. We then call the `calculate_monthly_payment` method to calculate the monthly payment for the policy, which we print to the console.

```python
# Check if the policy is active or not
if policy.is_active:
    print("Policy is active")
else:
    print("Policy is inactive")
```

In this example, we check the `is_active` attribute of the policy to determine whether it is currently eligible for coverage. If the attribute is `True`, we print a message indicating that the policy is active. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that the policy is inactive.
